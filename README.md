# LearnJava
Go on the journey with me of learning Java for fun! 
This will be going over the leasons from https://youtu.be/xk4_1vDrzzo Bro Code's 12 hour course of how to code in Java!
The reason of learning this is to learn how to make minecraft mods, datapacks, and running my very own minecraft server to maintain all by myself and not a third party application making it for me.

This is where all my notes are at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ghgz9IiaRynE1J3nXea4rikogBFgmZEGI8ejZ1j1Di0/edit?usp=sharing if you would like look at how I write notes in class and in day to day life <3
